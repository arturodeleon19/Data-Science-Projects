This dataset comprises images of diverse mushroom species, categorized into 100+ distinct classes, each representing a unique species.
The images capture mushrooms at various growth stages and environmental conditions, making the dataset particularly suitable for fine-grained image classification.
The data is structured into three CSV files:

    train.csv (for model training, csv only),

    val.csv (for validation and hyperparameter tuning, csv only),

    test.csv (for final evaluation, csv only),

    merged_dataset (image files with labels)
